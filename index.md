# Oregon Nonprofit Index

## About the project:

The Oregon Nonprofit Index is the first step of a more extensive project called the Nonprofit Index.  The Nonprofit index seeks to collect and provide a comprehensive database of all the nonprofits operating, first in Oregon, then the United States, and ultimately globally.

The project started with seeing the need for researchers who wanted to know about nonprofits operating in the US and learn more about their financial viability.  Looking at the data that was made available by the US Government about nonprofits it seemed pretty easy to see the location and business information if you understand how the government provided information and had the data skills to do the analysis.  

The goal of the of the Oregon Nonprofit index became to take the open information as provided, shape it, enhance it, and ultimately make it available not only to scholars but for anyone, even those who may be directly affected by the operations and services of the nonprofit.
