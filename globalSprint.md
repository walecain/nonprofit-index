#  About the [Global Sprint](https://foundation.mozilla.org/opportunity/global-sprint/)
Mozilla's Global Sprint is a :two: day collaborative hackathon. The Global Sprint pulls together a "diverse network of educators, engineers, artists, scientists, and many others come together in person and *online* to build projects for a healthy internet".  No matter your skill level, or where you are located in the world, you are welcome to get involved!

# About the Nonprofit Index
 
 Starting with Oregon, the purpose of this index is create a usable database of nonprofit organizations around the world :earth_americas: and provide critical information about these organizations. For this first round in creating an interactive visual, the project is concentrating on Oregon.

The Oregon Nonprofit Index is the first step of a more extensive project called the Nonprofit Index. The Nonprofit index seeks to collect and provide a comprehensive database of all the nonprofits operating, first in Oregon, then the United States, and ultimately globally.
